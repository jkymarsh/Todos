## Yet Another Todos App

This "Todo" application (originally by [kilon](https://github.com/uzikilon/Todos)) demonstrates a handy combination of Backbone, RequireJS, and Jasmine. Everything's structured in a logical manner and rather concise, if I do say so myself.

Some modifications from kilon's original include:

- Restructured directories: `test` is now in the top level of the root directory, the `js` directory has been restructured with a new `app` directory for app-specific scripts, and testing frameworks other than Jasmine have been removed from the project entirely
